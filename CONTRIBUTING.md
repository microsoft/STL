# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

# Contributions that we appreciate

## Submit a pull request that aligns with our goals and priorities

 * Look for pinned issues
 * Check issues under the labels `high priority` and `help wanted`
 * New contributors may also look into issues labeled `good first issue`

## Review a pull request

We welcome reviews from contributors! Especially if this review happens before maintainers' review.

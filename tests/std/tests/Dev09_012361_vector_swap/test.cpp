// DevDiv Bugs.12361 - "VS2005 Checked STL vector::swap causes incorrect iterator assertion in Release builds"

// C++03 23.1/10 requires that "all container types defined in this clause meet
// the following additional requirements: [...] no swap() function invalidates
// any references, pointers, or iterators referring to the elements of the
// containers being swapped."

// This was broken when _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING was disabled and _SECURE_SCL
// was enabled (the default in release mode, obtainable in debug mode).
// In this case, every iterator held a pointer to its parent container (in
// addition to the element being referred to) so that it could perform bounds
// checking. However, swapping containers would not update these parent
// pointers, so using iterators into those containers would perform bounds
// checks against the wrong containers. (Vector iterators perform bounds checks
// based on pointers, not indices, so they were broken even when the containers
// were the same size.) Also, one container could be destroyed before the
// other, wreaking havoc even more reliably.

// This afflicted all Standard containers (vector/deque/list, set/multiset,
// map/multimap, and string). When both _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING and _SECURE_SCL
// were enabled, swap() worked properly because the iterator debugging
// machinery walked through all iterators to update their parent container
// pointers. When both _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING and _SECURE_SCL were disabled,
// there were no parent container pointers to get mangled, with one exception:

// deque was even more broken. Due to its map-of-blocks structure, deque
// iterators maintained parent container pointers even when both
// _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING and _SECURE_SCL were disabled. These were also
// broken by swap().

// The fix for both of these problems was to introduce a dynamically allocated
// object, called the aux object, owned by every container when
// _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING is disabled and _SECURE_SCL is enabled (and
// additionally by deque when both _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING and _SECURE_SCL are
// disabled). An iterator now holds a pointer to an aux object, which holds a
// pointer to a container. This extra level of indirection solves the swap()
// problem; the containers and the aux objects do not change addresses, but
// the containers swap ownership of their aux objects, and the aux objects are
// made to point to their new owners, allowing iterators to find their parents
// correctly.

// Note, however, that this fix has NOT been applied to strings, because of the
// complexity of how they are passed between the separately compiled runtime
// and the client code.

// The aux object is allocated by the container's allocator due to a subtle
// issue. When creating a precompiled header, the compiler snapshots its
// internal data structures to disk. These internal data structures include
// STL containers, which use a special allocator to support this snapshotting.
// If the aux object is simply allocated by "new", then it will be missing
// when the PCH is reloaded.

// This fix has the following effects on container and iterator sizes
// (in 32-bit mode):
// 1. Non-string non-deque containers are 4 bytes larger in release mode with
// _SECURE_SCL enabled (as they must own an aux object now).
// 2. Non-string non-deque containers are the same size in debug mode with
// _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING disabled. Although they own an aux object now,
// an unnecessary data member was removed, keeping them the same size.
// 3. Non-string non-deque iterators are the same size in release mode with
// _SECURE_SCL enabled (their parent container pointer was replaced with an aux
// object pointer).
// 4. Non-string non-deque iterators are 4 bytes smaller in debug mode with
// _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING disabled. They gained an aux object pointer, but
// lost two unnecessary data members.

// 5. Deque iterators are 4 bytes smaller in release mode with _SECURE_SCL
// enabled (a duplicate data member was removed).
// 6. Deque iterators are 8 bytes smaller in debug mode with
// _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING disabled (three data members were removed, and an
// aux object pointer was added).

// 7. Deques are 8 bytes larger in release mode (regardless of _SECURE_SCL).
// This is because they must own an aux object now, although I don't know why
// this costs 8 bytes instead of 4. There seems to be padding involved.

// To summarize object sizes in the order,
// Debug HID/SCL, Debug SCL, Debug None, Release SCL, Release None:
// vector<int>: Previously 20, 20, 20, 16, 16. Now 20, 20, 20, 20, 16.
// vector<int>::iterator: Previously 12, 12, 12, 8, 4. Now 12, 8, 8, 8, 4.
// deque<int>: Previously 28, 28, 28, 20, 20. Now 28, 28, 28, 28, 28.
// deque<int>::iterator: Previously 12, 16, 16, 12, 8. Now 12, 8, 8, 8, 8.

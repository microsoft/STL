// The problem in this bug was that basic_string was getting dragged into locale0_implib.cpp,
// which is injected into the msvcprt.lib and msvcprtd.lib import libraries.
// This triggered ODR violations with non-default _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL settings
// (and more obscurely, with /J).
// In native code, the usual symptoms were debugger visualization problems.
// In managed code, /clr's metadata merge triggered linker errors.
// This test uses a facet to drag in locale0_implib.cpp, then uses a string.
// It's then compiled with lots of different options.
// This will explode if basic_string sneaks its way into msvcprt[d].lib again.

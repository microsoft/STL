# The `tr1` Legacy Test Suite

This is a legacy test suite. We regularly run it because it provides a small amount of additional test coverage.
We maintain this test suite in response to breaking changes as the product code evolves.
However, cleaning up this test suite is low priority, and we don't add new tests for new features here.

Note that the name `tr1` is an historical artifact. This test suite was originally added in the [TR1] era
(between VS 2008 and VS 2010) and was slightly expanded in later years before being frozen into its current state.

                        Skipped/failing tests in the libcxx test suite.</a> There are many reasons for such tests:
                    STL bugs, test bugs, compiler bugs, missing STL features, missing compiler features, etc.
                    To avoid double-counting, this line excludes missing STL features.

    <p>We don't count "patch papers" as extra work when one paper adds a feature
        and another paper modifies that feature before we've implemented it.</p>

    <p>This chart weights features equally, instead of weighting
        by usefulness for users or difficulty for implementers.</p>

    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Left axis:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="Counter" id="currentValue-avg_age"></span>
                    The average age of open pull requests, in days.</li>
                <li><span class="Counter" id="currentValue-avg_wait"></span>
                    The average "waiting time" of open pull requests, in days. This measures how long it's been since a
                    maintainer submitted a review requesting changes. Any other activity doesn't reset this clock.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Right axis:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="Counter" id="currentValue-sum_age"></span>
                    The combined age of open pull requests. The unit is PR-months (like kilowatt-hours);
                    for example, 5 PRs that were all opened 2 months ago have a combined age of 10 PR-months.</li>
                <li><span class="Counter" id="currentValue-sum_wait"></span>
                    The combined "waiting time" of open pull requests, in PR-months.</li>

    <canvas id="mergeChart"></canvas>

    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>For this chart, more is better. It includes merges into any branch
        and excludes PRs that were closed without being merged, which are rare.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="Counter" id="currentValue-merged"></span>
            Line: How many PRs have been merged over the past month.
            This uses a "30 day" sliding window, with some smoothing:
            <ul>
                <li>PRs merged 0 to 20 days ago are weighted at 100%.</li>
                <li>PRs merged 20 to 40 days ago are weighted from 100% to 0%.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bars: How many PRs were merged in each calendar month.</li>
    </ul>

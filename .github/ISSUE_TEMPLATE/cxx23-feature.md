Note: If this link appears to be broken, don't worry! Papers are often
revised during a WG21 meeting before the final vote. When that happens,
there's a delay of a few weeks between the end of the meeting
and the publication of the papers. When the papers are available,
the https://wg21.link redirector will start working.

Feature-test macro:
```cpp
#define MACRO_NAME MACRO_VALUE
```

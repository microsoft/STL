[PAPER_NUMBER](https://wg21.link/PAPER_NUMBER) PAPER_TITLE

Note: If this link appears to be broken, don't worry! Papers are often
revised during a WG21 meeting before the final vote. When that happens,
there's a delay of a few weeks between the end of the meeting
and the publication of the papers. When the papers are available,
the https://wg21.link redirector will start working.

Feature-test macro:
`#define MACRO_NAME MACRO_VALUE`

Note: We're still working on finishing C++20. Until we're done
with that (and the compiler implements distinct `/std:c++20` and
`/std:c++latest` options), we won't be able to review PRs for
C++23 features.

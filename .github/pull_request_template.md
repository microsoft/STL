<!--
Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes are written from
  scratch using only this repository, the C++ Working Draft (including any cited
  standards), other WG21 papers (excluding reference implementations outside of
  proposed standard wording), and LWG issues as reference material. If your
  changes are derived from a project that's already listed in NOTICE.txt, that's
  fine, but please mention it. If your changes were derived from any other
  project (such as Boost), you *must* mention it here, so we can determine
  whether the license is compatible and what else needs to be done.
